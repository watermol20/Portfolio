#### Course Description

---

Develops understanding of quantitative decision making by considering problems in accounting, finance, human resources, marketing, operations, and strategic business management. Examines the impact of uncertainty on business results, as well as the application of tools and methods useful in making business decisions under uncertainty. The course stresses the use of computer software in performing business analysis.

According to a [2007 BusinessWeek article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-08-02/b-schools-soft-on-soft-skillsbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice), a study conducted with more than 8600 managers has shown that decision making was ranked at the top of skills managers deemed most important. However, the study also examined the curriculum of 373 business schools to conclude that decision making was ranked fifth out of six categories concerning how well-represented it was in the core curriculum.

The primary objective of this course is to help you become more effective in any career you may choose. The course focuses on teaching you to build models to improve your decision making, and emphasizes providing you with a practical understanding of the use of decision modeling in making business decisions. In particular, we will focus on making decisions under uncertainty and decision making under constraints. You will gain a better understanding of the ways in which uncertainty affects business outcomes and decision making. You will also gain a practical toolset that will aid your decision making efforts in whatever career you pursue.

#### Course Objectives

---

By the end of the course, you should understand decision modeling concepts and be able to apply a number of methods to solve problems involving uncertainty or constraints in a variety of functional areas. Upon completing this course, you will

- Understand how to make decisions under uncertainty using decision theory, probability theory, expected values, and simulation
- Be able to formulate and solve constrained decision making models (specifically models with a linear structure)
- Be able to formulate and interpret associative models with multiple independent variables (using multiple regression)
- Have strengthened your ability to use software tools effectively in decision making and communicating quantitative analyses.
