This course introduces fundamental operations and technology management principles with emphasis on how knowledge concerning both operations and information systems is essential for achieving the strategic objectives of an organization. Topics covered include: information technology (hardware, software, mobile, database, data communications/networks, and security), information systems for competitive advantage, business intelligence systems, forecasting, and operations improvement. The aim of the course is to help students integrate methodological frameworks from both operations and the information systems disciplines. The application part of the course includes individual assignments in Excel and Access. Several individual assignments will be used to assess student learning. Because the prerequisite deals with technology applications, this class assumes that students have a solid background in both Word and PowerPoint.
