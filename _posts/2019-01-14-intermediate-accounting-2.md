#### Learning Goals

---

- **Communication Competencies** – Oral and written communication skills will be refined during the class. Students are expected to communicate in discussions within groups and in the larger class. Additionally, both graded and informal written responses are required for many assignments, with informal responses used as write-to-learn and graded assignments used to mirror the types of writing required in business settings.    

- **Problem Recognition, Prioritization, and Decision Making Competencies** – This class focuses on both problem solving and quantitative skills to resolve business questions.  While some problems are mathematical, others are theoretical, and both types of problems will require quantitative and qualitative data in the decision process.  Students will critically analyze a stated problem, determine alternatives, select a response, and, finally, support that answer.  In completion of the problems, students may use Excel, Edgar, RIA, and websites including the FASB, SEC, AICPA, and publicly traded corporations to obtain financial accounting information.

- **Ethics and Social Responsibility Competencies** – Accountants should always act within the bounds of legal authority.  Accountants also have a fiduciary responsibility to abide by professional standards.

In class, we will address the ethical implications of accountants’ actions when discussing the choices accountants have in recording and reporting financial

- **Leadership, Team and Personal Competencies** – During class sessions, students will often collaborate on structured problems.  Out-of-class group work is not required.  However, students often find that working together on homework is helpful, and students may want to form groups for this purpose.
 
- **Business Knowledge Competencies** – Financial accounting is critical for understanding businesses and how they report their successes.   Students will have continued growth in understanding the language of business (accounting) as used to help solve business problems.
