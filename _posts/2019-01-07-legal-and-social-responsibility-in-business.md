#### Course Description

---

Legal and Social Responsibilities in Business provides an overview of the legal and ethical concerns of managers.  Topics include governmental regulation of business, diversity in the workplace and the global legal environment.  We also explore private law topics including contracts and tort law. Since this course has also been designated as a “writing enhanced course,” we will devote class time to writing instruction and students will complete several writing assignments.

#### Learning Goals

---


- **Communication & Presentation Skills** – To be successful in any career, you must be able to communicate your ideas and your understanding of complex materials effectively in writing.  To that end, students will receive class instruction in writing an effective problem solving memorandum and will develop this skill throughout the course.  Students will be given brief writing assignments throughout the course, which will be graded with a check, check plus, check minus or zero (included in the participation component of the grade).  There is also a more in depth writing assignment (legal memorandum) that will receive a letter grade and be worth 20% of the student’s final grade.  Students are expected to adhere to the writing guidelines in the PSOBA’s *Expectations for Student Writing* as well as the guidelines for writing effective problem solving memoranda, distributed in class.

- **Analytic and Decision Making Competencies** – One of the objectives of this course is to provide students with an overview of legal problems confronting managers in the workplace.  Throughout this course students will apply legal rules to solve a wide variety of legal problems.  Students will need to demonstrate these creative and analytic strategic decision-making skills during class discussions, homework assignments, a legal memorandum and in essay examination questions.

- **International Business Competencies** – We will discuss international legal concepts and issues throughout the semester as they relate to the substantive material of the course and we will study specific international principles and doctrines, such as the principle of comity and the act of state doctrine.  We also will discuss cultural differences of different countries and how those differences have informed the development and current status of different legal systems, as well as different conventions for doing business in those countries.

- **Ethics and Social Responsibility Competencies** – We will discuss obstacles to ethical business behavior, corporate social responsibility and ethics in the global context.  We also will consider how issues of social consciousness have shaped the development of many areas of American law including U.S. constitutional law, contract law, tort law and employment law.

- **Business Knowledge Competencies** – It is crucial for students to recognize and understand the legal issues that managers encounter in business.  Consequently, we devote this course to introducing students to the American and international legal systems and providing them with an understanding of legal rules and applications from a wide range of substantive legal areas such as contracts, torts, employment law, constitutional law, and others.
