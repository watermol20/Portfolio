#### Course Description

---

Public opinion of the accounting profession has justifiably sunk in recent years.
You, as part of a new generation of accountants, have the opportunity to rescue the profession from the
excesses of its recent past by dedicating yourselves to acting ethically and
legally. This course aims to assist you in achieving that goal by familiarizing you with the AICPA’s *Code of Professional Conduct*, the IMA's , the IIA's *Code of Ethics* as well as state laws and regulations that will guide much of your professional life. The course also introduces you to a web of state and federal laws--including especially federal securities laws administered by the SEC and the newly-created PCAOB, and federal tax laws administered by the IRS.

If you violate professional standards and state and federal laws, you not only act unethically, you also court substantial legal liability. Accountants seldom intentionally choose to act unethically; more frequently, they simply do not recognize the ethical implications of situations they encounter. By studying individual administrative and court cases, you can learn from the mistakes of others and have the tools to avoid those mistakes when you encounter similar situations. We will study methods for improving your odds of acting ethically in difficult situations and of minimizing liability should errors nonetheless occur.
