#### Background and Requirements

---

Dr. David Jones age 62, has a dental practice and resides in Vancouver Washington. He recently sold his dental practice for $3,000,000 to Dr. Sally Tooth-Ferry. Dr. Tooth-Ferry financed her purchase with funds from a trust fund that she inherited from her Grandmother. As part of the deal, Dr. Jones received a contract to continue working for Dr. Tooth-Ferry, for 3 years at $200,000 per year, in order to introduce her to all his patients, while she takes over and develops the practice. After the 3 years is up, Dr. Jones plans to retire and move to a 5,000-acre cattle ranch that he owns outside Dallas Texas. Neither Washington nor Texas have State income taxes.

Dr. Jones has total investment assets of $15 million dollars (including the $3 million from the sale of his practice, which is currently parked in a 1% savings account at his local bank). Dr. Jones doesn’t really need any income from his investments today due to the $200,000 salary he will receive. But, he would like to put a plan in place so that he can get the $3 million working for him at better than the 1% taxable that he is earning at the bank. He is concerned about his taxes and also inflation eating away at his capital in the future. Even though Dr. Jones is considered to be rich, he doesn’t currently own any bonds and really has no experience with bonds. But, a dear friend has advised him to put the $3 Million into bonds in order to diversify his portfolio. Dr. Jones knows that there are basically three types of bonds that he can invest in: U S government bonds, corporate bonds, or something called municipal bonds. Since he really is a novice, he has decided to seek some help. He asked his friend for a referral of someone good (an advisor) that he could trust.

Dr. Jones got referred to your Investment team and he has tasked you with an assignment to construct a bond portfolio for him for the $3,000,000, plus an additional $2,000,000 that he has in another savings account in Dallas for a total of $5,000,000. He wants something that is safe, tax efficient and will give him a steady monthly income. The regular monthly income is not really required for 3 years until he is fully retired because he has the income coming in from Dr. Tooth-Ferry. Any interest earned prior (between now and the 3 years) can be reinvested in the portfolio as generated or added to his cash reserves for emergencies.  Another very important issue is that Dr. Jones is very concerned about the prospects of interest rates going significantly higher over the next 5 to 10 years. If he is correct and this was to happen, the value of his bond portfolio could go down by a lot too. He wants to know if there anything that he can do to protect his new investment bond portfolio?  Dr. Jones has also stated that he wants to maximize the after tax income on whatever you recommend in terms of the portfolio, so that he gets as near to the $200,000 as possible that he is currently earning from Dr. Tooth-Ferry, and does not have to dip into other assets if possible. If he does have to dip into other assets, he wants to get an idea of exactly how much of his outside funds might he need to tap annually to maintain his current lifestyle? Best case he would like to maintain his lifestyle plus be able to donate some money to one his favorite charities the St. Jude Children’s Orphanage. In your proposal, he would like to see how much he might be able to reasonable give to the orphanage each month? 

You must prepare a formal presentation that shows the following: An executive summary that can be a letter addressed to Dr. Jones, outlining your strategy for him, addressing all of his  key concerns and touching upon each of his goals and your team’s solutions for helping him. Additionally, you should have supporting exhibits that include: (1) Recommended portfolio holdings page (cusip #, name of bond issue, current rating, par value, coupon, maturity, recommended position (amount), call date, market price, ytm, ytc, total market value. (2) Transactions page: cusip, Bond issue, face – par value of position, price paid per bond, cost of bonds, accrued interest, total cost of each position, ytm, ytc, total cost of portfolio/recommended investment.(3) Projected cash flow page: Show each month where cash flow comes from on per bond basis, add up columns to get a total monthly income for each month and then calculate the annual amount of income. Make sure to take into account any income tax considerations. (4) Laddered portfolio chart – showing various maturities graphically (consider a yield curve) – want to make sure to explain your strategy.  It is very important that you try to smooth out his monthly income. He also does not want any default risk – he is very conservative.

#### Executive Summary

---

Dear Dr. Jones, 

Thank you for considering our firm, we hope our plan meets your needs and desires and that you’ll choose us for your financial needs.

##### Risk

Initially, we recommend that you invest your $5 million in highly rated investment bonds that are safe and will earn a higher rate of after-tax income than your current 1%, increasing at a minimum of 2.5%. Doing this will make your money work more efficiently for you than it would if it is sitting in your savings account. Additionally, we recommend that you retain $460,815.61 for a rainy day fund that will be completely liquid that you will have access to at any point in time. We agree with your concern that the interest rates will probably increase over the next 5-10 years, because of this we would suggest that you incorporate a laddered bond portfolio strategy where you have bonds maturing every few years. So that as the bonds come due, you can reinvest the proceeds into high rate bonds, thus mitigating your overall portfolio value fluctuations.

To protect you against default risk, we diversified your portfolio by personally selecting 18 bonds that are “A” rated and above by S&P, which are considered above the minimum safe investment grade of Baa. The geographic regions the bonds originate from are the Pacific Northwest, South West, and Mid-Atlantic. The majority of bonds are to generate revenue for places of higher education and public services within those geographical locations.

##### Cash Flow

We specifically tailored the years to maturity around your concerns of the market, the earliest year of maturity is 2020, and the latest is 2047. We recommend this so that you will have a safe, steady inflow of cash throughout the foreseeable future. Your average monthly income will be $16,585.42. With our recommendations, we believe you will be generating enough interest off of the bonds to be able to live comfortably and consistently have the opportunity to donate to St. Jude Children's Orphanage.

Before income tax, you will make $200,000, after-tax, you will make around $136,000 from Dr. Tooth-Ferry because the $200,000 in income places you in the Federal designated 32% tax bracket. We believe if the market stays consistent, you will be making $199,025 of nontaxable income due to your residence in Washington and Texas. The income you will accrue from our portfolio will put you around $63,000 over your income from Dr. Tooth-Ferry.

##### Closing Remarks

To reiterate, we believe we have created a portfolio that directly addresses your concerns and preferences towards the market without generating a significant amount of risk. At the same time, it will provide a steady flow of income to allow you to live comfortably while still being able to donate to charity. Keeping in mind that we have set aside a completely liquid $460,815.61, that you will have access to at any point in time. Thank you for granting us the opportunity to present our proposed portfolio. We look forward to hearing from you soon. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us at DunnSquad@associates.com.


Cheers,
