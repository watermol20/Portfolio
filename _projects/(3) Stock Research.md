You must research your stock investment idea thoroughly and answer the questions below. Please discuss the stocks that you want to research within your teams, to make sure that there is no duplication within the respective investment teams.

Team captains will have ultimate authority to decide who gets to research which company in the event of any conflicts. All initial stock ideas and accompanying completed research must be submitted by the assignment due dates in order for the student to get credit for the assignment added to the student’s grade. NO EXCEPTIONS!  Ultimately, teams will meet and present each other the various ideas for possible inclusion in the team’s investment portfolio.

In the letter of the shareholders, he talked about their growth rate and how they thank the stockholders for believing in them with the transition from being a part of their parent company Danaher, to becoming a split off from them with their stocks being sold on the NYSE. He talked about the results from 2016 and how they plan to keep progressing into the following year with their dedication to always improving. The tone if this address was very upbeat and optimistic in the outlook of their company, which is fantastic since they haven't been split off for that long. He mainly addressed how they will grow due to the constant improvement of the technology they have in the Fortive Business System. To see that they rely on it so much can worry some in case there is a fault, but I also feel like if they continue to follow the Kaizen way of improvement, they should be fairly stable. My main take away from this is that the CEO feels confident in his company and is ready to constantly make improvements to help the company keep growing.

##### Part B

From when I first started tracking my stock, Fortive (FTV), it was priced at $71.66 on February 5th, and on May 2nd, almost three months later, my stock is priced at $71.52, decreasing by $0.14. The value of the S&P stock went from $2648.94 on February 5th to $2635.37 on May 2nd, decreasing $13.57 on these past three months. Relative to the S&P 500, they have had similar trends when comparing the graphs, but Fortive was less volatile with increases or decreases. Both stocks had an increasing trend up until March 9th where they both reached the peak and then started to decline, Fortive decreased at a slow, consistent rate while the S&P had more sharp drops. Throughout these past three months, there were not any significant developments within Fortive, as they are still establishing their separate identity from their parent company Danaher and trying to maintain a stable stock.
