#### Reflection

---

While tracking my expenses at first I did not really pay attention and mainly looked at the numbers in my account and did not see where my money was going. Around mid-March I really started to be attentive and acknowledge my spending habits. In April I was going to be under budget initially but I ended paying for a few things that I was not expecting to pay which put me over. I also realized going into April that I was not going to be making as little as I initially thought since I was picking up extra shifts, so I readjusted my income and also my expenses since I noticed that I was spending a lot more than I initially thought I would.

I was slowly figuring out what kind of trends I have when spending and tried to fight against them. This happened in April since I was more determined to not spend money on alcohol as much and if I did I gave myself a personal limit of $20 for the month. I ended up staying within the budget at the end only spending $13.20.

Over the course of this I realized that I was not nearly saving enough money as well and decided that for each paycheck I was going to save 70% of it as one can see in the projections slide. I knew that I wanted to reach a goal of at least $500 in my savings account for a emergency fund. I was able to realize that I could reach that goal by the end of the May of I went through with the savings pattern I started when I included my tax refund.

Another take-away I had was that I go for long stretches without spending money and then I tend to spend a larger amount all at once. I need to be more attentive to this and try to space it out and or just focus on spending less when I have moments like that to reduce my over spending habits. I will be able to do that this summer since I am staying at a friends house for free and can pocket all of the money I make and only spend it on food, transportation, and entertainment based things that will be within a budget. I will need to update my budget since I will have an internship at that time generating a different level of income than when I was working with the career center.
